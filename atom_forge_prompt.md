I am making a game in Godot, I am new and have never made a game before - but I am moderately good at python (self taught for hobbies). im setting up the github and want a project plan to make the game,  learning godot as i go.

I will give you the premise, specific ideas i have and details about the game. I want you to create a project plan for it. It should have different stages that will facilitae learning godot and gaining experience as I go, but without having to comlpetely rebuild everything between each stage. I also want you to arrange the features so the easy and critical ones are avilable first. The idea being we get to a playable proof of concept first to asses the key mechanics if they are fun. 

Here is my idea:
Title: Atom Forge
Description: Manage a nuclear reactor and smash atoms together to make the right atoms to end level. This is done by atomic particles coliding to form heavier atoms, or atoms splitting for smaller ones. Atoms are made of protons, nutrons and electrons. Protons determine the atom, nutrons determine the stability - how likely it is to decay, electrons will affect the charge (used to colelct atoms).
At the end of each level there is a shop with random items you can buy that add modifiyers to your reactor.

Play Style: similar to vampire survivors or bro-tato or balatro. The game play is simple and repadative,, usually just algorithmically getting more difficult - roguelike. The real enjoyment and challenge is combing all the modifiers and bonuses in the right way... while it gets more and more difficult. You play by having a particle gun to shoot particles into the reactor.

Visual Style: I want to be styled in a very early retro gaming. Something that could be a control screen on a soviet nuclear facility. Kind of like the images in 'war games' movie.
 flesh out the feature more - and ideally suggestions and/or resources that will help to 

here are some ideas i want to implement:

 - different atoms you collect have different prices which is used in shop
 - atoms decaying will output radiation which needs to be shielded - or you get radiation levels - and sick
 - atoms are sucked up by eitehr positive or negative probes - based on the charge of the atom
 - atoms bouncing off the side builds up heat which needs to be managed
 - you play

Here are the different types of upgrades
 - Particle gun - different attachments and upgrades on how you input atoms and aprticles into the system
 - Cooling - to manage temp of reactor
 - Radiation shielding - also medicine to manage radiation exposure
 - Extraction tools - to suck out mroe atoms, be more specific on what they suck out

This is just the start - can you organise this into a nice guide and description for the game, I would also like to hear your recomendations for play mechanics, upgrades, etc.
