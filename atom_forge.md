I am making a game in Godot, I am new and have never made a game before - but I am fam moderately good at python (self taught for hobbies). im setting up the github and want a project plan to make the game,,  learning godot as i go.

I will give you the premise, specific ideas i have and details about the game. I want you to create a project plan for it. It should have different stages that willfacilitae learning godot and gaining experience as I go,, but without having to comlpetely rebuild everything between each stage. I also want you to range the features so the easy and critical ones are avilable first. The idea being we get to a playable proof of concept first to asses the key mechanics if they are fun.

Here is my idea:
Title: Atom Forge
Description: managed a nuclear reactor and smash atoms together to make the right atoms to end level. at the end of each level there is a show with random items you can buy that add modifieyrs to your reactor.


How to play the game:Description: You are running a micro nuclear reactor. Your goal is to get a certain number of different atoms from the periodic table. Different atoms are

Visual Style: I want to be styled in a very early retro gaming. Something that could be a control screen on a soviet nuclear facility. Kind of like the images in 'war games' movie.
 flesh out the feature more - and ideally suggestions and/or resources that will help to 

it's called Atom Forg
